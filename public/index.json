The system is run through a raspberry pi that controls pumps and pneumatic valves that control the vacuum valves. The goal is to be able to remotely pump down the system and record sensory data on the pi. This is part of an ongoing project to build night vision goggle (NVG) tubes. NVG tubes are under vacuum and require a metal coating on glass photomultiplier discs. Currently the system is able to do physical vapor deposition (PVD). Vintage Moped Electric Conversion\rI bought a Jawa Babetta moped off of Facebook with a shot engine and pedaled it back home. I rebuilt a gigantic drone motor I had spare so that the shaft was reversed to reduce cantilever. I welded and machined my own custom sprockets and built a 72 volt LiFePo battery that fits into an aluminum box I fabricated from several old MacBook cases. The controller is a high current VESC I slotted into a waterproof enclosure I fabricated from 3D printed parts and aluminum box tubing. I also redid the electronics to run a modern LED headlight (actually a car fog light), using buck converters to adapt down to 12 volts. I was able to keep the stock throttle by building a throttle adapter that allowed me to pull an analog throttle voltage from the original cable throttle It worked almost without maintenance for the entire Summer.

It's an odd but surprisingly intuitive steering design that uses a homemade head tube mounted with enough angle to provide stability at speed and tilt into steering. I handled most of the welding and mechanical design, and my EE friend built the battery, got the controller working and built the steering. It's built mostly from parts we found in the workshop and we pulled it off in only a few weeks. Some things are definitely jury rigged, but the end result is quite fun regardless.

The board utilizes a somewhat novel approach to skateboard steering and suspension designed with the poorly paved roads and walkways in and around MIT in mind. The steering, in particular, seems to be unique in this application. This was also an opportunity for me to learn lithium-ion battery building and fiberglass composite skills, as well as an opportunity to work with automobile-style linkages on a smaller scale.

Specifically, a broken Jawa Babetta 210. Rather than trying to fix a broken 1978 engine that\u0026rsquo;s notoriously bad to begin with, I set out to do an electric conversion.\nDesign #\rMost of the mechanical components are still just cleaned up stock parts, only the drive system is modified. I just dropped in a motor bracket where the engine once was, attached the motor controller under the front of the frame, and attached a battery box holder where the fairings normally attach.\nMotor Mod #\rThe original motor was a heavy lift drone motor MITERS pulled out of a lake at one point. This was a great choice because, unlike most motors, it was free. Unfortunately, these types of motors aren‚Äôt really intended for the kind of lateral forces caused by the chain.\nRather than attaching the sprocket to the far end of the motor as the motor was intended, and cantilevering the whole stack, I turned a replacement , longer shaft and pressed this in in place of the original;. This allowed me to attach a sprocket to the base instead.\nFront Sprocket #\rJawa 210 mopeds use a unique chain that has a 0.5in pitch, but unusually large rollers. The chain is not compatible with 415 sprockets, but 415 chain is more or less compatible with Jawa sprockets. I kept the original rear sprocket but replaced the chain and front sprocket with a 415 standard.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve cut internal keyways before and it\u0026rsquo;s just not an enjoyable process. When I can, I buy \u0026ldquo;weld-on keyed hubs\u0026rdquo;, which are bored cylinders with pre-cut keyways and set screws that I just weld to a flat sprocket. In this case, I just bought the sprocket, but less common sizes can be cut on a mill or waterjet and then ground to a taper.\nBattery #\rNothings too crazy here. Just a 20 series, 3 parallel set of LiFePo3 cells. Should do 150 amps continuously.\nBattery Box #\rOriginally, I welded up a steel box and mounted it to the frame. The idea was that I would be able to remove the discrete batteries from the top. However, the seat gets in the way.\nI whipped out my trusty angle grinder and hacked down the box. Then I fabbed an aluminum box from welded together MacBook cases. For the finishing touch, I added some canvas straps to hold everything together. Looks stylish, needs some decals.\nIn Action #\r","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/jonhenryposs/projects/babetta/","section":"Projects","summary":"Table of Contents:\nIntroduction Design Motor Mod Front Sprocket Battery Battery Box In Action Introduction #\rIn a fit of boredom while writing my thesis, I bought a moped.

I have since blown up its motor controller. My hope is to get this small scale model balanced and working properly and to apply this to rebuilding the much larger Z10. Electric Unicycles (EUCs) are self balancing. When the rider leans forward, the controller attempts to correct the lean by accelerating. This conveniently allows the unicycle to be driven without a controller or throttle.\nDesign #\rNothing too fancy here. An aluminum skeleton surrounded by 1/8in aluminum cowling. The unicycle is build around an 8in hoverboard motor. The motor shaft is clamped with a sort of v-block.\nMachining #\rThe motor I used for this build is off of a hoverboard. Its a hub motor - meaning the motor itself is fully integrated into the wheel. Hoverboards have wheels on either side, so the motor only has a shaft on one side. That\u0026rsquo;s great for a hoverboard, but forces the unicycle to have a sort of asymmetrical, cantilevered frame. I also wanted foldable pedals, mostly because they\u0026rsquo;re neat and all commercial unicycles have this feature. Ideally I\u0026rsquo;d like to come up with something to hold the pedals folded, like a magnet. But for now they just hang down.\nI discovered a fixture plate sitting around MITERS, which made machining the 1/8in aluminum cowling pieces much easier. Would have been easier to waterjet, but I could use the practice on the CNC anyway.\nI went ahead and tapped what felt like 100 M4 holes in cowling and bolted the side plates to the skeleton. Then I welded the cowling together from the inside. Worked alright, only a small amount of shifting and no obvious burn through. I kept the welds short to avoid filling in or distorting the newly threaded holes. This all functions mostly as a fender and a convenient place to mount the batteries and electronics. And style, style is important.\n3D Printing #\rIt took an embarrassing number of attempts to print this in a way that the bolts would actually fit\u0026hellip; somehow. Oh well.\nThe side cover plates integrate 18650 cells. A pain for wiring, but pretty stylish. Also uses brass inserts\u0026hellip; fancy! Because I expected to be overeager with testing, I also machined in mounting points on the aluminum cowling for Lipo pouch batteries.\nNow I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually end up using any of this, but the idea was that I would be able to hide enough 18650s into the outer shell. This was scrapped for a few reasons, but we\u0026rsquo;ll get to that\u0026hellip;\nElectronics #\rMounted up to the unicycle. Notice the lipo battery strapped to the cowling because, as I suspected, I could not be bothered to assemble the 18650 battery. The readings seem reasonable enough\nThe motor control is handled with a Vesc motor controller, which takes input from an ESP32 microcontroller for self balancing. I started with an MPU95 9axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) for angle measurement. Wired it up on a breadboard and everything worked. Soldered it all onto a proto-board and promptly blew up IMU. Fortunately, I found the faulty wire and a 6 axis MPU6050 dropped right into the same header. That worked fine.\nTuning #\rThe unicycle is balanced with a PID controller. Generally, it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable to tune these types of controllers experimentally. However, I obviously haven\u0026rsquo;t had much luck\nSwitching Gears New Electronics #\rNew VESC, new IMU, new batteries. Old batteries were lent out to a friend\u0026rsquo;s skateboard and were promptly destroyed. New setup is 48v with four 3s LiPo packs in series. I took these apart, added balance leads, and heat shrinked them back together. I also printed out battery boxes and electronics box that bolt around the aluminum frame.\nIt works!\nRyobification #\rLithium ion batteries are perhaps not the safest technology. Fortunately, batteries with built in safety technology that have been properly evaluated (UL Certified) can be had from the local home depot\u0026hellip;\nRyobi batteries are cheap but still UL certified. With my new access to free formlabs printing, I built a new sls printed shell with built in ryobi battery holders.\n","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/jonhenryposs/projects/unicycle/","section":"Projects","summary":"Introduction Design Machining 3D Printing Electronics Tuning Switching Gears: New Electronics Ryobification Introduction #\rI fell in love with electric unicycles after spontaneously buying a broken Segway Ninebot Z10 on craigslist and fixing it up.","title":"Uno Electric Unicycle","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rTable of Contents:\nIntroduction Design Front Suspension Triple Clamp Electronics In Action Introduction #\rMITERS has a long tradition of building scooters and road vehicles that fail quickly once the first snow falls in Boston. I grew up in California, where there is no snow. But I also grew up surrounded on three sides by field and know the value of off-road vehicles. Regardless, I really like putting tracks and large-travel suspension on things that probably don‚Äôt need them. The result is the Snowtercycle. Snow + Motorcycle = Snowtercycle\nDesign #\rWell, it‚Äôs a motorcycle with tracks. Full suspension. Electric.\nFront Suspension #\rI‚Äôm using an older form of suspension, leading link suspension. Rather than relying on telescoping tubes, leading links use steel linkages and standard shock absorbers. This suspension is more resistant to corrosion because there is no need for perfectly smooth, rust free, telescoping tubes. The suspension rises while braking, instead of collapsing and limiting travel like a more traditional suspension.\nLots of interesting fixturing and machining operations to make the leading link suspension. The tubes were coped (cut to mate up nearly perfectly with the other tubes) on the bridgeport mill.\nI‚Äôm very happy with the welding. Apparently I‚Äôve still got it.\nTriple Clamp #\rCNC machined from aluminum. It‚Äôs not bad, but I need to move the tubes further forwards and increase the size to cover the head tube and prevent water incursion into the bearings.\nMassive thrust bearings just because they‚Äôre what I had around. Bearing races press fit into the head tube.\nThe bottom triple clamp is press fit around the fork axle and bolted tight.\nElectronics #\rKelly KLS-N Sinusoidal motor controller (72v 350A) running a Motenergy ME0907 motor (100 A continuous). That‚Äôs about 6 hp continous, peaking at about 15 hp.\nI‚Äôd like to enclose the control panel at some point, but for now it‚Äôs suitably clicky with lots of gauges.\nIn Action #\rSounds like a two stroke and its pretty bumpy on the road.

This however, the BOAT has 10 in tires and independent suspension to handle the lunar landscape that are the streets of Cambridge. Behind the suspension you\u0026rsquo;ll see the spring return system. It turns out that mountainboard springs are exceptionally expensive so I had to come up with something else. Rubber innertubes are free so I punched out circles and stacked them into rubber springs.\nDeck #\rI didn\u0026rsquo;t have any steel on hand so I started with the deck. After my early attempts with vacuum bagging fiberglass composites on the kayak restoration, I was feeling pretty confident with the process. The deck is 3/4in home depot plywood with a layer of fiberglass on either side. No peel ply or breather in an attempt to get a nice, shiny side. Worked out reasonably well, though one edge folded over.\nBattery #\rBig board means big battery. 10s 7p specifically. This is my second attempt building a battery from scratch but far from the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with lithium-ion cells. The cells are salvaged from old hoverboard packs. Every cell had to be checked but I had exactly 70 functional cells by the end. They\u0026rsquo;re welded with my homemade spot welder. It\u0026rsquo;s a rewound microwave transformer on which I may do a writeup later\nBattery Box #\rThe battery box will be fiberglass formed around a wooden plug. The plug is painted and waxed for release. Perfect fit! Some foam for added padding and to hopefully deal with vibration. Dual Flipsky 4.12 VESC. 3D printed panel mounted XT60 connectors just for style. It is surprisingly hard to find panel mount connectors, but I wanted everything removable. In the future I think I may go with bulkheads and connectors on short pigtails. In any case, I ended up with 5 pin aviation plugs for the hall sensors and MT30s for the current carrying motor wires. Clearly the board is now far too small to fit the battery box. My father found some 1/4in aluminum at the harbor so I\u0026rsquo;ll be cutting out an aluminum deck next. Circular saw and jigsaw should do nicely with the right blades.\nAll the Metal #\rI originally planned to machine and waterjet aluminum for the suspension. However, with campus closed, my available tools were reduced to a mini lathe and hand tools. I ended up building nearly everything from steel using printed paper patterns. It worked reasonably well, but obviously the board is quite heavy - somewhere around 67lbs.\nThe hub motors work reasonably well. I think I\u0026rsquo;d stay away from hub motors on any future skateboards, they\u0026rsquo;re just far too heavy for this sort of use. Geared hub motors would maintain the simple power transmission with a bit more torque. I can still climb hills with a bit of speed and it handles the trails just find.\nRiding and Testing #\rClearly it does okay. Apparently full face helmets are more or less a requirement for esk8. Something about how skateboarders fall at higher speeds leads to a higher risk of impacts to the jaw and back of the head.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a better view of the suspension. The board itself is much more rigid than a standard longboard. The suspension comes from the shocks rather than the board itself. The trucks could actually be implanted on any board.\nFuture plans:\nNeeds more low speed torque, maybe an actual transmission system. That would require a non-hub motor and added complexity. I plan to look into a tadpole trike style for simplified power transmission and possibly better turning. For now, the motor mounts need to be improved. The shafts seem to be slipping.\n","date":"13 January 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/jonhenryposs/projects/boat/","section":"Projects","summary":"Introduction Deck Battery Battery Box All the Metal Riding and Testing Introduction #\rThe sidewalks of MIT are not exactly smooth enough for normal skateboarding.
